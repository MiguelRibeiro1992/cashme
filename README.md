# 🛒🏃‍♂️ Cash Me (Fast check-out app)

My final JAVA Upskill program project.
In collaboration with Gonçalo Lopes and Diana Clemente, we developed a fast-checkout app. 
For more details, message me. 

**Important notes**

The app works with a localhost and personal database, so stores, items and categories must be added in phpmyadmin so they can have representation on the website.
Objects can be added after creating an account, change it to admin (0 to 1) on the database and accessing localhost:8080/admin/login into admin dashboard.
